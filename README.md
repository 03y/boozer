# üç∫ Boozer
Boozer is a platform which stores users, beers and consumptions!

## Team
1. [03y](https://github.com/03y): full-stack, sysadmin
2. [Adam-W2](https://github.com/Adam-W2): frontend(?), data analysis
3. [EuanRobertson1](https://github.com/EuanRobertson1): full-stack(?)
4. [Choob303](https://github.com/Choob303): requirements gathering and user testing

## Outline
* Data sourced from dbas and users.
    * This means the data will be sparse at first, but item uses will conform to a bell-curve. Once most of the commonly used items are added, adding new items will be rare.
* User creates account, adds items and records consumptions.

## Workflow
* Monorepo for backend (api), frontend(s) and db scripts (and laster on data analysis stuff).
* CI for backend (gh actions).
* Use issues and PRs to keep track of work.
    * Review PRs before merge: increase understanding of project.
* Use BDD
## Plan
**No time restraint on stages**
- [x] DB & backend implementation of users and items.
- [x] DB & backend implementation of uses of items.
- [ ] Frontend implementations (in progress).
- [ ] Data analysis.

## Stack

| **Service**   | **Software**   |
|---------------|----------------|
| **DB**        | PostgreSQL     |
| **Backend**   | Go             |
| **Frontend**  | HTML/JS        |

## Getting Started

The easiest way to run the entire application stack is with Docker Compose. For detailed instructions, please see the [backend documentation](./backend/README.md).

---

## DB

- **[PostgreSQL](https://postgresql.org)**.
- **Tables**:
  1. **Items**
  2. **Users**
  3. **Consumptions**

---

## Backend

- **[Go](https://go.dev)**.
  - **[Gin for HTTP API](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/gin-gonic/gin)**.
  - **[PGX for DB connection](https://github.com/jackc/pgx)**.
  - **BDD tests with [hurl](https://hurl.dev)**.
- More details in the **[Backend Specification](./docs/backend.md)**.

## Frontend

- **Web Frontend**:
  - Basic **HTML + JS** (possibly look into use of JS framework).
  - Ensure it performs well on **mobile devices**.
- More details in the **[Frontend Specification](./docs/frontend.md)**.
